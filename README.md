All of my solutions to the book "Cracking the Coding Interview"

I created a little template file and a python script to copy and paste that file to a directory.
To use it, make sure you're in the root directory of this repo and type the following:
```
python file_generator.py <path to file>
```
An example would be:
```
python file_generator.py ./strings_and_arrays/p20.py
```
which would create the file "p20.py" in the "strings_and_arrays" directory. If the directory does not exist, it will create it for you.

Here's to cracking the coding interview, and hopefully getting a job someday!

I've also added my own implementation of a MinHeap. It's very basic. The underlying data structure for the heap is an array. I didn't want to use a "Node" class because I felt like I would get more out of the array implementation.
