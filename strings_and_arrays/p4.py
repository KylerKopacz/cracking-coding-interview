'''
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words

ANALYSIS:
    - Runtime Complexity: O(n)
        - You have to know what you're working with once again. You don't know the final character counts
        to run the palindrome analysis until you hash all the values so.
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
        - You have to hold a hash table with all the values that come with the string that you're looking at
    - Best Case Runtime: O(n)
        - I should really verify these with the book.
